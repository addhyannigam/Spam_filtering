# Spam_filtering
Welcome to my Spam Detection project! 🚀
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify messages as Spam or Not Spam.

✨ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately detect spam messages using various machine learning techniques.
The process involved:

1. Data Cleaning 🧹

   Removing unwanted characters, punctuation, and noise from the text data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

   Understanding the dataset through visualizations and key statistics.

3. Data Preprocessing ⚙️

  Tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer).

4. Model Building 🤖

  Training machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.) for spam classification.

   Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, confusion matrix.
